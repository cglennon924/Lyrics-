## User Story
```
AS A music fanatic
I WANT an easier way to learn more about the songs I like
SO THAT I can be more up-to-date with the latest news while reading along to the lyrics 
```

## Description
In this project we were required to come up with a site that uses two different API's (application program interface), a different styling format besides Bootstrap, and mash them together. We decided to use Wikipedia, MusixMatch, and Bulma. With these API's, we came up with a site called Lyrics +! 

Lyrics + allows the user to type in their favorite songs and search for more information about them; such as Wikipedia links and lyrics through MusixMatch. One would be surprised at what they can learn about their selected song. 

Once the user presses the submit button on the first HTML page, that information is processed in our result.js file sorting out what should be displayed onto the index2.html page. This whole page is formatted through our CSS page and Bulma framework. The Wikipedia links are displayed nicely on the left side of the screen, while the MusixMatch is displayed onto the right side of the screen.

We hope you enjoy your experience at Lyrics +!
